            <p>A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a culinary dish. It is also used in medicine. A doctor will    usually begin a prescription with recipe, usually abbreviated to Rx or an equivalent symbol.</p>

                Many ancient Greek recipes are known. Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his     Deipnosophistae. Athenaeus mentions many other cookbooks, all of them lost.
